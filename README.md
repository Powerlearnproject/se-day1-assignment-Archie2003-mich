5.Ensures Security and Compliance: Software engineers implement security measures to protect data from cyber threats.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term software engineering was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
This milestone marked the recognition of software development as an engineering discipline rather than just programming.
It addressed the software crisis, where large software projects were becoming unmanageable due to poor planning and increasing complexity.
The conference emphasized structured programming, modular design, and rigorous testing to improve software reliability.
2.The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by introducing concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Languages like C++, Java, and Python popularized OOP, making software more reusable, scalable, and maintainable.
OOP principles enabled the development of large-scale applications, including enterprise systems and web-based platforms.
3.The Agile Manifesto (2001)
In response to the limitations of traditional waterfall methodologies, a group of software developers introduced the Agile Manifesto in 2001.
Agile development emphasized flexibility, collaboration, continuous improvement, and customer feedback.
It led to the widespread adoption of Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps, improving the efficiency of software development and delivery.
Agile methodologies have since become the standard approach for modern software projects, especially in fast-changing industries.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning
Defines project goals, scope, feasibility, and resource requirements.
Helps in risk assessment and cost estimation.
2.Requirement Analysis
Identifies and documents user and system requirements.
Uses tools like Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for clarity.
3.Design
Architects the system structure, defining UI/UX, database design, and system models.
Includes High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).
4.Implementation (Coding)
Developers write code based on design specifications using programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.
Follows coding best practices and version control.
5.Testing
Ensures software quality through unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Identifies and fixes bugs before deployment.
6.Deployment
Releases the software for users, either as a full launch or in stages.
Can be on-premises, cloud-based, or via continuous deployment pipelines.
7.Maintenance & Support
Addresses bugs, security updates, and performance improvements post-deployment.
Ensures long-term software efficiency and adaptability to changing user needs.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies;
1. Approach
Waterfall follows a sequential and linear process, moving from one phase to the next without going back. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative and incremental, allowing for continuous feedback and improvements throughout development.
2. Flexibility
Waterfall is rigid, meaning changes are difficult to implement once the project has started. Agile is highly flexible, accommodating changes based on evolving requirements and user feedback.
3. Phases
Waterfall consists of distinct phases such as Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, and Deployment, each completed before moving to the next. Agile has overlapping phases, breaking work into small iterations (sprints) where planning, development, and testing happen simultaneously.
4. Customer Involvement
In Waterfall, customer interaction is limited to the beginning (requirement gathering) and the end (final product delivery). Agile involves continuous customer collaboration, with regular feedback shaping the software.
5. Testing
Testing in Waterfall happens after development is completed, increasing the risk of discovering major issues late. Agile follows a continuous testing approach, identifying and fixing problems early.
6. Documentation
Waterfall requires extensive documentation before development begins. Agile prioritizes working software over documentation, focusing more on adaptability.
7. Risk Management
Waterfall has higher risk, as issues may be discovered late, making them costly to fix. Agile has lower risk, as iterative development ensures problems are identified and resolved early.
-Contrasting Waterfall and Agile Methodologies;
1.Approach
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach, allowing for ongoing adjustments throughout the development cycle.
2.Flexibility
Waterfall is rigid, making it difficult to accommodate changes once development has started.
Agile is highly flexible, allowing modifications at any stage based on feedback and new requirements.
3.Phases and Workflow
Waterfall has distinct, separate phases (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment). Each phase must be finalized before moving forward.
Agile has overlapping, iterative cycles (Sprints), where planning, development, and testing happen continuously.
4.Customer Involvement
Waterfall involves the customer mainly at the beginning (requirements gathering) and the end (final product delivery).
Agile keeps the customer involved throughout the development process, regularly incorporating their feedback.
5.Testing
Waterfall conducts testing only after the development phase is complete, which can lead to late discovery of major issues.
Agile integrates continuous testing throughout development, identifying and fixing issues early.
6.Documentation
Waterfall requires detailed documentation before development starts, ensuring a structured approach.
Agile prioritizes working software over documentation, keeping documentation minimal and adaptable.
7.Risk Management
Waterfall has higher risk, as problems discovered late in development can be costly and time-consuming to fix.
Agile has lower risk, since its iterative nature ensures early issue detection and resolution.
8.Project Suitability
Waterfall is best for stable projects with well-defined requirements, such as government, banking, and construction software.
Agile is ideal for dynamic projects requiring frequent updates, such as mobile apps, startups, and SaaS products.
